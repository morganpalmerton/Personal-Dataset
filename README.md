![Average Number of Penalties Per Game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morganpalmerton/Personal-Dataset/master/HockeyFigure.png)

This bar graph demonstrates the average number of penalties per game for each team that played in the 2019 NHL playoffs. 
I chose to look at ice hockey data specifically for the NHL. NHL hockey games are my 	favorite thing to watch on TV and I love the game. Something very relevant to the 	outcome of a game is the number of penalties taken by a team. Not only is a player put in 	the penalty box and you are a man down, but penalties can also change the emotions of 	the team and cause more aggression between players and the teams overall if they feel it 	was a bad call or biased one way. 

With this motivation in mind, I chose to answer the following question: Which team in the NHL was the most highly penalized in the 2018-2019 playoffs?
